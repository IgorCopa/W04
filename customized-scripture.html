            34 Therefore, they did as <strong>${name}</strong> commanded them, and he went forth and stood 
            to contend with those who stood by the waters of Sebus; and they were in number not a few.

            35 Therefore they did not fear <strong>${name}</strong>, for they supposed that one of their men could slay 
            him according to their pleasure, for they knew not that the Lord had promised Mosiah that he 
            would deliver his sons out of their hands; neither did they know anything concerning the Lord; 
            therefore they delighted in the destruction of their brethren; and for this cause they stood 
            to scatter the flocks of the king.

            36 But <strong>${name}</strong> stood forth and began to cast stones at them with his sling; yea, with mighty 
            power he did sling stones amongst them; and thus he slew a certain number of them insomuch 
            that they began to be astonished at his power; nevertheless they were angry because of the 
            slain of their brethren, and they were determined that he should fall; therefore, seeing that 
            they could not hit him with their stones, they came forth with clubs to slay him.

            37 But behold, every man that lifted his club to smite <strong>${name}</strong>, he smote off their arms with 
            his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword, 
            insomuch that they began to be astonished, and began to flee before him; yea, and they were 
            not few in number; and he caused them to flee by the strength of his arm.
